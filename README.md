# Locate-the-place-using-image

### This python file displays and prints the Location of the image.

Please on your "LOCATION" in your pc or mobile while taking a picture from your devce.

## Note:
Don't share the images in any social media and use here because while sharing in that platform it reduces the sizes of file by removing metadata like GPS information.
